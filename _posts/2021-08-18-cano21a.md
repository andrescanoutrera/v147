abstract: 'The ISIPTA meetings are the primary international forum for presenting
  and discussing advances in the theory and applications of imprecise probabilities.
  They are organized once every two years by SIPTA, {\em The Society for Imprecise
  Probabilities: Theories and Applications}. The first edition took place in Ghent
  in 1999. This time the {\em 12th International Symposium on Imprecise Probabilities:
  Theories and Applications} was planned to take place in Granada, Spain, from 6 to
  9 July, 2021, but will now be an essentially virtual event due to the Covid-19 crisis.
  Even so, we will uphold the ISIPTA tradition of combining a friendly and cooperative
  style with a strong emphasis on in-depth discussion and interaction.  '
