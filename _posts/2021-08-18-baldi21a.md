title: Logical Approximations of Qualitative Probability
abstract: 'We provide approximations of qualitative probability, that is, comparative
  structures which are representable by probability measures. We introduce sequences
  of qualitative belief structures, based on the ideas of Depth-Bounded logics Dâ€™Agostino
  et al. (2013b), and identify the conditions under which: <ul> <li>a qualitative
  sequence <em>approximates</em> a qualitative probability;</li> <li>a qualitative
  probability can be approximated.</li> </ul> '
